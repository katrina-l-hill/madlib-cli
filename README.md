.venv requirements

- Created and activated virtual environment

## Initialize/run your application

- Created __init__.py files in madlib_cli and tests folders

## Tests

    How do you run tests? Ran "pytest" against functions to check tests
    Any tests of note? test_read_template_returns_stripped_string(), test_parse_template(), test_merge(), test_read_template_raises_exception_with_bad_path()
    Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc. I completed all tests.
